# Lost Items Community Website

## Project Overview
Welcome to the Lost Items Community website, a platform dedicated to connecting people and their lost items. Our community-driven approach allows users to not only report found items but also search for personal belongings they've lost, anywhere and at any time.

## Key Features
- *Search & Report*: Users can easily search for lost items or report found ones with detailed descriptions and photos.
- *Interactive Map*: An integrated map shows the locations where items have been reported lost or found, enhancing the search process.
- *User Profiles*: Registered members can create profiles, manage their posts, and interact with other users.
- *Notifications*: Users receive updates via email or SMS when a potential match for their lost or found item is reported.
- *Community Board*: A dedicated space for users to share success stories and helpful tips on finding lost items.

## Technologies Used
- *Frontend*: React.js for a dynamic user interface, with Bootstrap for styling.
- *Backend*: Node.js with Express for server-side logic, secured with JWT for authentication.
- *Database*: MongoDB for storing user data and item reports, accessed through Mongoose ORM.
- *Deployment*: Deployed on Heroku for easy access and Docker containerization for consistency across development and production environments.
